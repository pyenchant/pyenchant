<h3 id="faq_feedback">How do I report bugs, give feedback etc?</h3>
<p>
You can use the issue reporting tools on the <a href="http://github.com/rfk/pyenchant/issues">github project page</a> or send the author an email at
&#114;y&#097;&#110;&#064;&#114;f&#107;.&#099;&#111;&#109;&#046;&#097;&#117;.  For general questions, please use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyenchant-users">PyEnchant mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="faq_license">How is PyEnchant licensed?</h3>
<p>
Like the underlying Enchant library, PyEnchant is made available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a> with a
special exemption allowing linking with proprietary spellchecking plugins.
</p>

<h3 id="faq_similar_projects">Are there similar projects available?</h3>
<p>
There are several projects to produce Python bindings for the
<a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">aspell</a>
spellchecking library, including <a href="http://www.republika.pl/wmula/proj/aspell-python/index.html">aspell-python</a> and <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pyaspell/">pyaspell</a>.
The <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/myspell-python/">myspell-python</a> package offers a Python wrapper for the MySpell engine.  It is also
possible to invoke a command-line program such as ispell, as shown in this
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/117221">ASPN Python Recipie</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="faq_advantages">What are the advantages/disadvantages of PyEnchant over other solutions?</h3>
<p>
Most of the solutions listed above are tied to a single spellchecking
platform, such as aspell or MySpell.  By contrast, Enchant supports
multiple spellchecking platforms.  A good discussion of why this is
an advantage can be found on the <a href="http://www.abisource.com/enchant/">Enchant website</a> under the heading "Enchant and Multiple Backends".</p>
<ul>
<li>Different backends can be used for different languages, depending on which
does a better job</li>
<li>Integration with the user's "native" spellchecker, whatever that may be</li>
<li>This flexibility is transparent to the application programmer</li>
</ul>
<p>As explained above, PyEnchant is available under the GNU LGPL.  This may
mean it can be used in some projects where other libraries (such as
GPL-licensed libraries) cannot.</p>
<p>
The Enchant API is also generally simpler than that provided by other
spellchecking solutions.  This can be an advantage or disadvantage depending
on the needs of your program.
</p>

<h3 id="faq_unicode">How does PyEnchant handle Unicode/non-ASCII text?</h3>
<p>
As of version 1.1, PyEnchant supports input of both standard Python
strings and unicode strings.  It follows the standard Python practice
of returning unicode strings when unicode strings are given, and 
standard strings when standard strings are given.
</p>
<p>
As of version 1.5, PyEnchant is compatible with the new string infrastructure
of Python 3, and uses it unicode strings consistently throughout.  It does
not accept bytestrings in Python 3.
<p>
Unfortunately, the author (a native English speaker) does not have
a great deal of experience with the use of unicode.  Any help with
testing the support for unicode input/output would be greatly
appreciated.
</p>

<h3 id="faq_shootout">Which Enchant provider should I use? (Aspell, Ispell, MySpell...?)</h3>
<p>The simple answer is: whichever works best for your language of choice.
The source distribution contains a tool to conduct a <a href="shootout.html">
Provider Shootout</a> given an appropriate set of test data, which can be
used to determine which provider performs the best for your language.</p>
<p>Ideally, this choice should be made by the system administrator when
enchant is installed.
One of the premises of the Enchant library is to relieve the user from making
such low-level choices.</p>
