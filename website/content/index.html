<h3>More about PyEnchant</h3>

<p>PyEnchant is a set of language bindings and some wrapper classes
to make the excellent <a href="http://www.abisource.com/enchant/">Enchant</a>
spellchecker available as a Python module.
The bindings are created using <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ctypes.html">ctypes</a>.
It includes all the functionality of Enchant with the flexibility of Python
and a nice "Pythonic" object-oriented interface.  It also aims to provide
some higher-level functionality than is available in the C API.

{% syntax python %}
>>> import enchant
>>> d = enchant.Dict("en_US")
>>> d.check("Hello")
True
>>> d.check("Helo")
False
>>> d.suggest("Helo")
['He lo', 'He-lo', 'Hello', 'Helot', 'Help', 'Halo', 'Hell', 'Held', 'Helm', 'Hero', "He'll"]
>>>
{% endsyntax %}
