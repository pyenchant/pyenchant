Installation
=============

PyEnchant is compatible with Python versions **3.5** and above at
the time of writing - `tox.ini <https://github.com/pyenchant/pyenchant/blob/master/tox.ini>`_
being the authoritative source.

The PyEnchant package is available `on pypi <https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant>`_.

You can install it with ``pip`` as usual.

However, PyEnchant needs to find the Enchant C library in order to work properly. The way to
achieve this depends on the platform you are using:

On Linux
--------

The quickest way is to install `libenchant` using the package manager of
your current distribution. PyEnchant tries to be compatible with a large
number of `libenchant` versions. If you find an incompatibility with
your `libenchant` installation, feel free to `open a bug report
<https://github.com/pyenchant/pyenchant/issues>`_.


On macOS
--------

The quickest way is to install `libenchant` using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    brew update
    brew install enchant

On Windows
----------

The `enchant` C library depends on `glib2`, which poses some interesting challenges.

There are two ways to use install the PyEnchant library on Windows,
both with their pros and cons.

Using the binary wheel
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The Windows binary wheels on *pypi.org* contain a pre-compiled `enchant` library,
if your Python version is compatible, it will get used by `pip` automatically.

Pros:

 * "Just works" in the majority of cases

Cons:

 * The only provider is ``hunspell``
 * The only installed dictionary is for the English language
 * A copy of the `glib2.dll` and other dependencies are included
 * This does not work if your Python installation uses 32 bits

Using MinGW
+++++++++++

An other way to use `pyenchant` is to install MinGW (for instance
with `Chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/>`_), then use  `pacman` to install
the `libenchant` and all its dependencies.

In that case, you can ask pip to **not** use the wheel by running it like this:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install --no-binary pyenchant

Pros:

 * You are using the "official" way to build `enchant` one Windows, thanks
   to the work of the `MinGW` maintainers
 * You can use all the supported providers
 * You can add a new language using `pacman`

Cons:

 * It only works with the ``python3`` binary of the ``MinGW`` distribution,
   so typically *not* the one you've installed from `python.org`.
