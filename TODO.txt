PyEnchant:

  * implement a tkSpellCheckerDialog to compliment the wx one
  * Expand CmdLineChecker and make it ispell-compatible

  * rename "tokenize", it tends to conflict with the top-level stdlib
    module of the same name (although I've no idea why)

Distribution:

  * mark our wheels as "platlib" when bundling dependencies
